# Note Taker React App

-This front end web app allows a user to create sticky notes on the fly.

- It allows people user to keep track of their personal notes on multiple devices by allowing access via web interface that is available on both desktop and mobile platforms.

- It utilizes material ui thus, provides a very user friendly interface. 

- Check out the live demo here: https://mehmetgokcek.github.io/note-taker-react-app/

## What is next?
- I am planning on creating a REST API back then that would allow the user to record, retrieve, edit and delete the personal notes.
- It would also be a good idea to add user log in to ensure multiple users can log in to manage personal notes
